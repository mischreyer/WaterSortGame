# WaterSortGame
Fun game to play and challenge your thinking process in your free time.

How to play:
1. When running the main class 4 bottles will be randomly filled with water (colors red, blue, green).
2. You will be asked to insert the bottle number (1-4) that will be the source bottle.
3. When a source bottle is selected you will select a bottle that will be filled using the top color of your source bottle. (Because the contents of the bottle represents a stack)
4. Now try your best to fill the bottles in a way that 3 of the 4 bottles are filled to the top with matching colors.

This minigame is a great representation of how stacks and arraylists work.
